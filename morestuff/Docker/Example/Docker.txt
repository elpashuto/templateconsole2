[REMOVE CONTAINERS]
docker ps -all

docker stop ....

docker container prune

[REMOVE IMAGES]
docker images
docker image rm ...

docker images prune

=========================================

[CREATE CONTAINERS]

docker run --rm -d -p 801:801 gopher:latest

(--rm = auto remove after it stops)
(-d sends it to background -> much more recomended than console, you can see logs connect to the machine or in docker desktop)

docker run --rm -it gopher:latest /bin/bash

(if you -d and -it it will never stop because you sent it to background a running shell)

docker run -d -it gopher:latest /bin/bash

[ENTER RUNNING CONTAINER]

docker exec -it bf873acfea25 /bin/bash


[Dockers can speak between them]

docker inspect 1c1fb2c4249b | findstr IPAd
